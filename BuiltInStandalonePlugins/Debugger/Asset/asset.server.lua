--[[
	Entry point for the plugin instance created in the "asset" datamodels:
	eg. Edit, Play (Client), and Play (Server).

	Listeners that need access to the specific active data model should be
	created here.

	If there are no instances that need DM-specific access, it is ok to remove
	this file from the hierarchy AND, importantly, the rbxp.
