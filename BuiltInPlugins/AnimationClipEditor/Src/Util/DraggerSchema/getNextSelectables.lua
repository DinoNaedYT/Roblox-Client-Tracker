	the selection on clicked, or selecting a sub-selectable underneath the
	clicked selectable.

return function(draggerContext, currentSelection, dragInfo, isDoubleClick)
	-- Return a new array of selectables here for that to become the selection.

	-- Here "dragInfo" is the dragInfo you returned from dispatchWorldClick
	-- if you returned FreeformDragging, or the "event" which was passed to
	-- dispatchWorldClick if you returned Ready.

	-- If you want the current selection to remain selected, just return nil:
